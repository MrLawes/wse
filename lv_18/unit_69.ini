I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to let you know the meeting is about to start!

I'm not trying to be rude, but I've heard you tell that story at least three times before!

It's just a thought, but don't you think the design should be changed ?

I don't want to intrude, but your child shouldn't be playing so near the road.

I can infer from your tone that you're unhappy.

You are such a good friend that you didn't answer any of my phone calls or emails.
