I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to let you know the meeting is about to start!

I'm not trying to be rude, but I've heard you tell that story at least three times before!

It's just a thought, but don't you think the design should be changed ?

I don't want to intrude, but your child shouldn't be playing so near the road.

I can infer from your tone that you're unhappy.

I appreciate it even though I don't need a job.

I can sense your sarcasm.

You are such a good friend that you didn't answer any of my phone calls or emails.

I'm so disappointed. I really wanted you to do it.

He is sort of struggling.

We all thought our co-worker, Jackson, was on vacation or something like that, because he hadn't been in the office.

How many people are coming to the event? I'm not absolutely sure. I'd say thirty odd guests.

You are hesitant.

You seem very frustrated.

He is quite skeptical.

They were very neglectful of their studies.

I'm quite distressed about my dog running away!

I know that is what you wanted.

Do you know who is inheriting his property ?

Stocks and bonds are always fluctuating in value.The market is risky.
