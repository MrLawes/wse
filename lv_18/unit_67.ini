I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to let you know the meeting is about to start!

I'm not trying to be rude, but I've heard you tell that story at least three times before!

It's just a thought, but don't you think the design should be changed ?

I don't want to intrude, but your child shouldn't be playing so near the road.
